      <title>P-Stream v5.3.0 released!</title>
      <description>Lots of quality of life improvements and changes and a huge number of bugs fixed!

Additions:
- Made the skip intro button available to all users, not just those with a febbox token. Though the one with febbox is still the best quality!
- Added a new "Last Used Source" setting. This will automatically prioritize the source that successfully provided content for the previous episode.
- Improved thumbnail generation to be more accurate. Now generates 127 thumbnails instead of 63, and generates them randomly rather than sequentially.
- Added the ability to copy a specific subtitle with its delay value to your clipboard and a paste button to paste it as the current subtitle. Great for moving subtitles between sources!
- Reworked the settings page to be more user friendly on mobile devices. It's now broken into seperate pages for each section.
- Added a subtle fade in effect to all images being loaded.
- Added new toggle to disable the caption background blur effect. This fixes flickering on some browsers with HDR content.
- Added the ability to bookmark an entire movie collection at once as a group.
- Added the ability to rename and edit bookmark groups.
- Added the ability to edit the title and year of a bookmark.
- Moved reorder button to the settings page.
- Hid arrow buttons on carousels when at the start or end of the carousel. (Thanks @Smith M.)
- Added a border to the time stamp popup when hovering over the progress bar. (Thanks @Zisra)

Fixes:
- Fixed watch progress getting reset when using manual source selection.
- Encoded all search queries so it's now possible to search for movies and shows with special characters like "V/H/S".
- Fixed native subtitles not being displayed correctly and not showing in PiP and for mp4 streams.
- Fixed the PiP button not displaying on mobile devices anymore.
- Reworked the discover page to load much faster and more efficiently.
- Fixed the febbox token input not fitting correctly on mobile devices.
- Fixed finished and unwatched movies and episodes being saved, yet never being shown. They wont save anymore!
- 0-9 keyboard shortcuts to skip to 0-90% progress no longer work when other keys are held down.
- Fixed the search bar not being positioned correctly on mobile devices, especially within the PWA.
- Fixed "i" being shown as "I" in subtitles, this was an issue with some languages that use lowercase "i" intentionally.
- Fixed watch parties not able to be joined from the home page.
- Updated the style of many outdated elements on the site. 
- Various other minor bugs squashed!

Thanks to everyone who has been testing the beta and providing feedback!

      <description>I know many sources have been inconsistent recently, so to help with the trouble, we're introducing a new manual source selection setting!

      <description>The Firefox extension is back in the store! You can now update it to the latest version.

You’ll need to REPLACE the old one with this one to get future updates. But the old one will also work fine, it’ll just have a warning. HAVING BOTH BREAKS THE SITE, so pick one!

Sorry again!

      <title>Extension issue for Firefox!</title>
      <description>If you're using Firefox with the P-Stream extension, you may have noticed that it says updates are unavailable and that the extension is violating policies. Yikes!

Heres what happened: I accidently deleted my Firefox account that had the P-Stream extension. 
The extension did NOT violate any policies, it was just deleted. For some it says that when it gets removed.

I just created a new account and re-submitted it, so it should be back in the store soon. I'll post here when it is.
Just to clarify, the extension is still working perfectly fine, it's just the updates that are not working. When the extension is back in the store, you can update it to the latest version.

The whole story behind me accidentally deleting my Firefox account is on our Discord server, feel free to ask there! (link below)

I apologize for the inconvenience!</description>

      <title>Help support P-Stream!</title>
      <description>If you enjoy P-Stream, please consider donating to help maintain it!

We're looking at a new server, but we need your help! If a couple people could chip in and cover the $20 (per month) that would be much appreciated. There is only one ad on the site, and we want to keep it that way!

It will improve uptime for FED API and faster EU streams, another proxy which we desperately need.

If you are interested in donating, please check the link below!

      <description>There's now a quick way to see the source of a subtitle on the external subtitle selection menu!

In addition to the new badges, there's now a new subtitle source: Febbox! Thanks to Nemo for helping P-Stream fetch subtitles from Febbox without needing to set up the Febbox token! It also allows for the subtitles to be used on any source!

      <title>P-Stream v5.1.1 released!</title>

- Now anyone can watch trailers on the details modal! A custom proxy or the extension no longer required. (Other IMDb info still requires the extension or proxy)
- Added a resume watching page.
- Added checks and label to see what embed a source is currently on. (e.x. fox for xprime)
- Updated curated movie lists and editor picks!
- Added an onboarding reminder for content that is not found but there are other sources that may have it.
- Using a custom subtitle source with no baked in ads.
- Fixed a broken URL issue caused by the Dood source.
- Fixed 2x boost overlay sizing.
- Fixed speed boost not working on mobile.
- Other bug fixes!

P.S. I wanted to highlight TrinityHades, a community member, who is working on adding Safari support to the P-Stream extension! It's not quire ready yet but soon mac users will be able to use the extension to watch P-Stream on Safari!

      <title>Some sources are currently down</title>
      <description>Some sources are currently down. We are aware of the issue and are working to resolve it. 
Unfortunatly, many sources needed to be disabled due to them showing NSFW content and xprime is experiencing a temporary outage.

I recommend you set up the febbox token to get access to FED API and CIA API, the best sources at the moment. You can find the febbox token setting at the botton of the settings page!

If you are interested in adding a new source to P-Stream, I recently created a new guide for it! Check the link below.</description>

      <title>Clarifying current source issues</title>
      <description>I wanted to appologize for some recent issues with FED API and Vidify. 
Firstly, I wanted to note that P-Stream does not host or control any of the content. Everything is streamed from third party sources.

Vidify:
You may have noticed (hopefully not) that Vidify has been showing some NSFW content. This is due to protections they have to prevent us from using them as a source.
This should now be resolved, and hopefully prevented in the future.


FED API:
We’re aware of the issues with FED API and are looking into it. However, the problem is with febbox, not the FED API scraper.
Once FED API gets the link from febbox it’s entirely out of our control. There’s not much we can do, but maybe there’s something we can find to answer why this is happening and hopefully prevent it.
Please be patient. I suggest using another source, or use the “open in” download option to stream the febbox mp4 within the player of your choice!
